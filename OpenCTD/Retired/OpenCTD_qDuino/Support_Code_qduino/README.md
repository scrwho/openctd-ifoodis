Here you will find supplemental software to simplify building and testing the OpenCTD. 

[**MS5803_14_test**](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/tree/master/Support_Code/MS5803_14_test) reads just the pressure sensor in standard configuration so that your can confirm its functionality.

[**TempProbeTester**](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/tree/master/Support_Code/TempProbeTester) allows users to batch test up to 24 temperature probes to check quality and accuracy before installation. 

[**simple_serial_for_EC_calibration**](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/tree/master/Support_Code/simple_serial_for_EC_calibration) allows users to calibrate the Altas EZO conductivity circuit.
