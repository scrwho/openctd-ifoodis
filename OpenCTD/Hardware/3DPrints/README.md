# OpenCTD 3D Printed Models

The  primary 3D printer files for assembling an OpenCTD are:

- [OpenCTD_14Bar_Baseplate.3mf](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/blob/main/Hardware/3DPrints/Models/OpenCTD_14Bar_Baseplate.3mf)
- [OpenCTD_ElectronicsChassis_Bottom.3mf](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/blob/main/Hardware/3DPrints/Models/OpenCTD_ElectronicsChassis_Bottom.3mf)
- [OpenCTD_ElectronicsChassis_Top.3mf](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/blob/main/Hardware/3DPrints/Models/OpenCTD_ElectronicsChassis_Top.3mf)

For [alternative](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/tree/main/Hardware/3DPrints/Models/Alternatives) build pathways, several ooptions for the sensor baseplate and electronics chassis are available. [Accessories](https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD/tree/main/Hardware/3DPrints/Models/Accessories) that aid in the storage of the CTD are also available.
